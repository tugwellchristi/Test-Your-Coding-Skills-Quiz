# Coding Skills Quiz

## Project Description
As a coding bootcamp student, I wanted to create a timed quiz about JavaScript fundamentals that stores scores so I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. I've included the following content and functionality: 

- When the start button is clicked, a timer begins and a question is presented
- After answering a question, another question is presented
- When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over
- After the quiz is complete, the score and the user's initials are recorded
